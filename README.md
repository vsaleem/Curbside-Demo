# Curbside

## Description
            
Curbside is an application that allows users to get rid of personal items when moving, without the hassel of selling, throwing the items away or even meeting the people who wants to claim the item. By listing the item with a photo, description and location on the Curbside App, other users will be show interest in these items and are able to pick them up from the curbside location the owner has provided, which will be displayed using a 1 mile radius on the map. 
```
** Files tackled **
I worked on the user authentication, mongodb database, middleware, and multiple file configurations for this project.

## User story

``` 
    Curbside demonstrates a full stack MERN application.

    User story :
        As a person who wants to acquire free home-goods and other items
        I want an app that shows a listing of various items with their relative locations, that people are giving away for free
        So that I can pick the items up from the curbside with minimal interaction.
